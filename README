Group 5 

Game Description: An intuitive, easy to learn shooting, survival game inspired by Vampire Survivors, but using
a 3D city scenario with streets, cars, buildings and other assets, where the player controls a mage using a 
crossbow to eliminate skeletons infestating the city. 

This work has been created with Unity 2019.4.4011 and using Github to manage the main repository at

which can include code suggestions and code inspiration for our work:
